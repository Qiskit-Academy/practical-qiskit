# Qiskit in Practice

Learn Qiskit with simple practical examples

</center>

### Why learn Qiskit?

In short, because it rocks.

Quantum computing is different from classical computing. So it might be hard to make a case and say "you should learn because it's better". However, there are many examples where quantum outperforms classical and even in some cases, does things that are simply impossible with classical computers.

### Are there any prereqs?

Generally, you should know some college maths and some coding background wouldn't hurt. Since we're taking a more practical learning approach, we want to try to keep theory out of this repo as much as possible. But sometimes there's no way around it so we might use some equations here and there.
